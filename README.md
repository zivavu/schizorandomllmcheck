# AI-Generated Random Number Generator Collection

A collection of unnecessarily complex and creatively implemented random number generators, each created by a different AI model.

## Overview

This project showcases different approaches to random number generation, each designed by a different AI language model. The implementations range from chaotic and complex to absurd and whimsical, demonstrating the creative variations in how AI models approach the same task.

## Live Demo

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view all implementations via a convenient tabbed interface.

## Featured Implementations

### Claude Opus (o3-mini.html)

A "Schizo Random Number Generator" that employs nested arithmetic, trigonometric chaos, recursive continued fractions, and URL-based entropy to produce a final random value.

### Gemini Pro (gemini25proexp.html)

The "Unfathomable Number Generator" creates entropy through a complex multi-phase process involving cryptographic source mixing, recursive chaotic accumulation, and prime number manipulations.

### DeepSeek (deepseekr1.html)

An "Ã†theric Number Manifestation Interface" that uses quantum state superposition concepts and non-Euclidean probability distortion to generate numbers with visual effects.

### Claude Sonnet (sonnet 3.7.html)

The "Hyper-Abstract Quantum-Inspired Entropy Materializer" leverages entangled particle simulation, Feigenbaum constants, and Galois field operations to produce random values with theatrical visualization.

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies
- Uses iframes to seamlessly display different implementations
- Tab interface for easy navigation between generators
- Each implementation is self-contained and runs independently

## Why This Exists

This collection demonstrates how different AI models approach the same simple task (generating a random number) with vastly different levels of complexity and creative flair. It serves as both an entertaining showcase and an interesting comparison of AI-generated code styles.
